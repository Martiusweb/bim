## What in this repo ? ##

It is quite a mess here, but don't worry, this was because we were working and
testing stuffs. Now, we are going to merge our work to build Bim with the parts
we already have.

If you are looking for stable code and documentations, have a look at the
**master** branch. It only contains tested and supposed stable code.

If you want to see the work in progress branch, look at **unstable**. Branches
*paul* and *martin* are base branches for our work, derivated from unstable.

The branches **labs**, **prototype** and **dev** are historical branches with
code snippets we want to keep.
